# Attention
u have to download [Chromium](https://download-chromium.appspot.com/)
and add it to **this directory** so puppeter can work with electron without the need of user to install a chromium for puppeter.

Folder name should be **chrome-win** so don't change it!
Check [weedy.js](https://github.com/WeedyDev/youtube-downloader/blob/main/scripts/weedy.js) script for more infos
